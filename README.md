# MyBlogTemplate
Hii guys..
Eid Mubarak! to all of you.
Hope you all are doing well. Guys stay safe and follow all the safety guidelines. Step outside your house only when it is necessary. 

Today I was going through some templates on [w3 Schools](www.w3schools.com). I found a blog template. I have designed it using pure html and css. You can check the code for the template here and modify it as per your needs.

Here is a video of the responsive blog template.
